How to get this working:
1. npx truffle init
2. npm init
3. install all the dependencies in package.json and create the scripts
4. copy the .js test and .sol contract 
5. create migration script 2_initial_sudoku.js (not sure of the nomenclature but it might be semantically sensitive to filename)
6. run npm run ganache-cli in other terminal 
7. uncomment truffle-config.js development network ? 
8. npm run test

I think that's all. It requires particular config and download of dependencies
