prior to 5/27: 

- struggled with code, completely lost and not much time to work but did what I could. Was confused about a lot of things- not frustrated per se but faced with deadline (somewhat self imposed but also keeping up with cohort), knew I had a lot to learn
- Then looked at solution code. Started working with that lightly both main contract and tests, in parallel. Working through initializeGame() function in both solution and test, taking it slowly trying to understand

5/27 - came prepared to code but instead read a lot of docs. Started re-reading overview, and then came to deploying smart contracts, wanted to learn about that, so read on ethereum.org on deploying them. Read all their suggested prereq articles, such as accounts, transactions, EVM, even learned what a trie data structure is. 

Things are making more sense slowly. Will hopefully code next time. 

5/28 - going back, learning basics of hardhat and ethers to get more context

5/30 - learning more about tests
